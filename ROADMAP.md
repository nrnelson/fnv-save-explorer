# FNV Save Explorer — Roadmap & Status

A cold-start working document: where the project is, exactly what's been reverse-engineered, and
how to resume. For the user-facing overview see [README.md](README.md); for build/agent notes see
[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

---

## 1. Goal & scope

Build a from-scratch tool to **analyze** and **edit** Fallout: New Vegas `.fos` save files.
Chosen direction: C# / .NET 10, a reusable **Core library** plus a **WPF GUI** and a **CLI**, and
to **reverse-engineer the save body** (globals, change forms) — not just the documented header.

The single principle that makes editing safe: the **retention model**. `FalloutSave` keeps the
entire original byte array and only decodes regions we understand, recording the offset of each
editable field. Saving with no edits reproduces the file byte-for-byte; edits are **same-length
splices** so nothing shifts. This is mandatory because the body's File Location Table stores
*absolute* offsets — a length change would invalidate them. **Never break round-trip identity.**

---

## 2. Quick start

```pwsh
dotnet build FnvSaveExplorer.slnx            # NOTE: solution is .slnx (XML), not .sln
dotnet test  tests/FnvSaveExplorer.Tests/FnvSaveExplorer.Tests.csproj
dotnet run   --project src/FnvSaveExplorer.App                 # WPF GUI
dotnet run   --project src/FnvSaveExplorer.Cli -- <command> "<save.fos>"
```

Real saves for testing live in `C:\Users\<user>\Documents\My Games\FalloutNV\Saves\` (16 present
during development: two characters "Nathan" and "Mace Windu" at various progression, plus autosave/
quicksave). The test theory auto-discovers them (and a local `samples/`) and skips if none exist.
**Never write to the originals** — all edit demos write to new files.

CLI commands: `dump`, `check`, `flt`, `probe`, `hex`, `globals`, `stats`, `setstat`, `formids`,
`findplayer`, `playerdump`, `special`, `setspecial`, `skills`, `setskill`, `inventory`, `setcount`,
`setcondition`, `names`, `notes`, `setlevel`, `caps`, `setcaps`, `karma`, `xp`, `setkarma`, `setxp`, `diff`, plus
R&D helpers `walk`, `refdump`, `edlscan`, `invsig`, `notescan`, `resolve`, `idiff`, `fdiff`, `find`, `irefscan`.
Run with no args to list them. (`edlscan <dir>` aggregates the modded ExtraDataList grammar + a deterministic-path
tally across a save folder; `invsig <dir>` prints a per-save decoded-inventory signature for byte-identical-decode checks — §4i;
`notescan <dir>` aggregates the read-note markers — flag-value + `0x1F`→NOTE + inventory-reference tallies — §4k.1.)

---

## 3. Architecture & key files

- **`src/FnvSaveExplorer.Core`** (`net10.0`, UI-agnostic)
  - `FalloutSave.cs` — parser, retention writer, all decoders + same-length editors, change-form walker.
  - `ByteReader.cs` — little-endian cursor; throws `SaveFormatException` with the failing offset.
  - `FileLocationTable.cs`, `GlobalData.cs`, `MiscStats.cs`, `PlayerSpecial.cs`, `PlayerSkills.cs`, `PlayerInventory.cs`, `PlayerNotes.cs`, `SaveScreenshot.cs`.
  - `ReferenceChangeForm.cs` — reference (REFR/ACHR) change-form helpers: the `0x7C` field tokenizer, `changeFlags` describer, the per-stack extra-data catalog/decoder (`TryReadStackExtra`) behind the deterministic inventory walk, and the generalised typed-entry ExtraDataList walk (`WalkExtraDataList`/`ExtraEntryLength` — modded-grammar RE, inspection-only) (§4i).
  - `TesPlugin.cs`, `PluginDatabase.cs`, `GameDataLocator.cs` — FormID → display-name resolution from the game's ESM/ESP masters (§4h / §6.3).
- **`src/FnvSaveExplorer.App`** (`net10.0-windows`, WPF MVVM) — `MainViewModel.cs`, `MainWindow.xaml`
  (+ code-behind for file dialogs). Tabs: Plugins, File Location Table, Edit (name/level/save#/SPECIAL),
  Skills, Inventory, Notes, Misc Stats, Body. Left panel: screenshot + character summary.
- **`src/FnvSaveExplorer.Cli`** — `Program.cs` (top-level statements; all commands + diagnostics).
- **`tests/FnvSaveExplorer.Tests`** — xUnit; 160 tests. Synthetic-save unit tests + theories over
  every real `.fos` found (round-trip identity, globals, Misc Stats, SPECIAL + skills + inventory locate + edit).

---

## 4. The `.fos` format — validated spec

Little-endian; signature `FO3SAVEGAME` (shared with FO3; NV adds a 64-byte language block). Header
region uncompressed. Strings are `[u16 len][0x7C][bytes][0x7C]`; `0x7C` ("|") delimits fields
throughout the file (header, globals, change forms).

### 4a. Header (offsets from a real save)
```
0x00  char[11]  "FO3SAVEGAME"
0x0B  u32       saveHeaderSize        -> screenshot starts at 0x0F + saveHeaderSize   (KEY)
0x0F  u32       version (0x30)
0x13  0x7C
0x14  64 bytes  language (null-padded "ENGLISH")   [NV only]
      u32 width, u32 height, u32 saveNumber        (each followed by 0x7C)
      str name, str title, u32 level, str location, str playtime
      screenshot = width*height*3 bytes raw RGB (e.g. 512x288)
      u8 trailer (~0x1B; docs say 0x15 but it varies)
      u32 pluginStructSize, u8 pluginCount, 0x7C, then pluginCount x prefixed strings
      -> body begins (BodyOffset)
```

### 4b. File Location Table (body start) — verified across all 16 saves
Five absolute offsets then three counts (NV has one fewer global-data table than Skyrim):
```
[0] FormIdArrayCountOffset   [1] UnknownTable3Offset (footer near EOF)
[2] GlobalData1Offset (12 records)   [3] ChangeFormsOffset   [4] GlobalData3Offset (1 type-1000 rec)
[5] GlobalData1Count (=12)   [6] GlobalData3Count (=1)   [7] ChangeFormCount (e.g. 4134)
```

### 4c. Global data — `[type:u32][length:u32][data]`
Table 1 holds 12 records, types 0–11: `0`=Misc Stats, `1`=Player Location, `2`=TES, `3`=Global
Variables (large), `4`=Created Objects, `6`=Weather, … (5, 7–11 unlabeled). **Candidate labels (UESP Skyrim
spec, §8a — verify; FNV's set differs from Skyrim's):** `5`=Effects, `7`=Audio, `8`=SkyCells; 9–11 are
FNV-specific (Skyrim moves higher categories into a separate table).

**Misc Stats (type 0):** `u32 count, 0x7C, then count x (u32 value, 0x7C)` — Pip-Boy counters
(quests/kills/locations…). Positional (no names stored). Decoded + editable.

### 4d. FormID array & change forms
- FormID array: `u32 count` then `count` x `u32` (full FormIDs; high byte = mod index).
- Change forms reference forms by **iref** = index into the FormID array, encoded as a **3-byte
  big-endian refID**. Player: FormID `0x07` (base TESNPC_) and `0x14` (PlayerRef ACHR); find their
  irefs in the array, scan change forms for the 3-byte refID to locate the records.
- **Player SPECIAL:** 7 consecutive bytes immediately before the length-prefixed player-name field
  inside the player base record (fenced by `0x7C`). Located by name-adjacency within the change-forms
  region. Verified: every save sums to 40 (chargen budget), consistent per character. Editable.

### 4e. Player skills — actor-value modification block (PlayerRef / ACHR change form)
Skills are **not** stored inline like SPECIAL and **not** in the base record (that record is FaceGen
data, byte-stable across same-character saves). They live in the volatile **PlayerRef (FormID `0x14`)
change form** as an **actor-value modification list**:
```
[count*4 : u8][7C]   then count × ( [avIndex : u8][7C][value : float32 LE][7C] )   # 7 bytes/entry
```
AV-index → skill (verified by setting all 13 to distinct values via console `setav` and diffing):
`0x20`=Barter, `0x22`=Energy Weapons, `0x23`=Explosives, `0x24`=Lockpick, `0x25`=Medicine,
`0x26`=Melee Weapons, `0x27`=Repair, `0x28`=Science, `0x29`=Guns, `0x2A`=Sneak, `0x2B`=Speech,
`0x2C`=Survival, `0x2D`=Unarmed (`0x21` = FO3 "Big Guns", unused in NV — the index run skips it).

**Storage is sparse.** The engine computes a skill from base + SPECIAL + perks + tag skills and only
writes an entry when it *deviates* — a fresh character stores none, a typical played save ~3. So the
tool reads/edits exactly what's stored; it can't enumerate all 13 on an unmodified save, and adding a
missing entry would be length-changing (unsupported). Editing a stored value is a safe same-length
float splice. **Locator:** the lone `0x7C` also occurs inside float bytes, so single-entry blocks are
indistinguishable from noise; we anchor on the length prefix and pick the validating block with the
most recognised skills (≥2). Verified across all 16 saves.

### 4f. Change-form record header — the walker (general; was next-step #4)
Every change form is a fixed header then a variable payload:
```
[refID : 3 bytes BE]   index (iref) into the FormID array
[changeFlags : u32 LE]
[type : u8]            low 6 bits = form type; high 2 bits select the length width (0→u8, 1→u16, 2/3→u32)
[version : u8]         0x1B on NV
[length : u8|u16|u32]  payload size, width per the type byte's high bits
[data : length bytes]
```
**Verified decisively:** walking from `ChangeFormsOffset` yields exactly `ChangeFormCount` records and
lands *precisely* on `GlobalData3Offset` on every save tested (both characters, fresh→4 h). `Core`
exposes `EnumerateChangeForms()` (each record's iref/FormID/flags/type/data span) and `PlayerRefChangeForm`;
the CLI `walk` validates the count/landing and histograms form types. This is the foundation the
inventory decode (and any future per-record browser) builds on.

### 4g. Player inventory — item list in the player's inventory change form
The player's carried items are **not** in the PlayerRef (`0x14`) ACHR record (that holds actor state —
6 bytes fresh, 293 bytes mid-game, never growing with items). They live in a **dedicated reference
change form** whose **iref = (PlayerRef iref) + 1** (type `0x41`). After the record's 3D/position
preamble and a zeroed array, the items are a run of stacks:
```
[ref : 3 bytes BE][7C][count : u32 LE][7C]  ( extra-data: 7C-delimited condition/equip fields, not yet decoded )
```
**The reference is the FormID-array index + 1.** Each entry's 3-byte `ref` is the FormID-array index
**plus one** (index 0 reserved), so the item is `FormIdArray[ref - 1]` and `count` is the entry's **own**
stack count. **Confirmed by a controlled in-game diff:** save A → `player.additem 000E2C6F 1` → save B →
consume one → save C (Saves 28/29/30). `idiff` pinned a single u32 in the inventory change form going
**1 → 2 → 1**; that entry's `ref` resolved to *Antivenom* only through the `- 1` index. The `- 1` fix
alone makes the whole list correct: every stack now resolves (Stimpak ×10, Super Stimpak ×3, Doctor's
Bag ×3, Weapon Repair Kit ×4, Bleak Venom ×5, Antivenom ×1, Bottle Cap/caps ×18, Pip-Boy 3000, …), with
**no spurious entries** — the earlier `?` rows (ACHR/ACRE/REFR) were just `FormIdArray[ref]` landing on
the neighbouring form. (A prior reading mistook this for a one-slot "count lag"; that was an artefact of
the off-by-one and only held when references happened to be consecutive.) **Decoder:** scan the record
for runs of entries (`ref ≠ 0` whose `ref - 1` resolves, both `0x7C` delimiters, a sane count whose upper
bytes aren't the `0x7C` delimiter), breaking a run only when the gap to the next entry exceeds a wide
window (2048 B — a modded item's condition + weapon mods can split the list by hundreds of bytes, and a
big inventory can fragment into several runs), and pick the run with the **most distinct references**, not
the most entries: a misaligned read of a record's non-item region forms a long run that repeats a handful
of refs, so it scores far lower than the genuine item list. The wide window also absorbs a few non-item
bytes; when the name resolver is available the CLI/GUI **hide entries that don't resolve to an item**, so
the list is both complete and clean. Verified on real VNV saves: one that decoded 0/127 now reads its full
inventory (Lead, caps, reloading components), and a 193 KB record's split item list reunites — a known
1,414-count ammo stack that was dropped now appears. Editing a count is a **safe same-length splice**.
Names resolve via §4h.

> **Superseded:** the 2048-byte window above is gone — the per-stack extra data is now decoded, so each stack's
> exact length is known and the walk is deterministic. See **§4i** for the current decoder + the extra-data catalog
> (condition / equipped / mods). The list **start** is no longer a whole-record most-distinct ranking either: on
> vanilla saves it is a pure structural walk (MOVE skip + fixed havok array + sized ExtraDataList → the `vsval`
> stack count → first item); modded ExtraDataLists fall back to a forward scan (§4i).

### 4h. FormID → display name — reading the game's ESM/ESP masters
Every FormID the tool surfaces (inventory above all) is resolved to a human name by a small custom
**TES4 plugin reader** (`TesPlugin`) over the game masters. FNV stores the `FULL` (display) name
**inline** per record (no Skyrim-style `.STRINGS`), so names read directly. FO3/FNV use **24-byte**
record and group headers; a record's `DataSize` excludes its header, a group's `GroupSize` includes it.
```
record  [type:4][dataSize:u32][flags:u32][formID:u32][vc:8][data]
field   [type:4][size:u16][data]               # EDID = editor id, FULL = display name (zstring)
```
- **GRUP-skipping:** only top-level groups whose label is an item record type (`WEAP ARMO ALCH AMMO
  MISC BOOK NOTE KEYM IMOD` + NV `CCRD CHIP CMNY CDCK`) are decoded; the rest are seeked past, so the
  245 MB `FalloutNV.esm` + 9 DLC/pack esms index in ~2 s.
- **Compressed records** (flag `0x00040000`) are `[u32 decompSize][zlib]` → inflated.
- **DLC renumbering:** each plugin numbers forms against *its own* master list, so `PluginDatabase`
  remaps every plugin's local high byte onto the save's load order (master-name match; a form's own
  high byte == the plugin's master count). Plugins are indexed in load order so overrides win.
- The `Data` folder is auto-detected (`GameDataLocator`, with an override); absent → FormIDs stay hex.
**Verified** on a real save: all 10 plugins parse, 3,985 named forms indexed, and the player inventory
resolves fully (Stimpak / Vault 21 Jumpsuit / Weapon Repair Kit / …). Where the tool surfaces other
FormIDs (e.g. `formids`), a runtime-created `0xFF…` FormID shows `(created)` and a form not in the
masters shows `?`.

**Source mod (which DLC/mod an item is from).** A FormID's high byte (mod index) indexes the save's load
order (`Plugins`), so the owning plugin is `Plugins[modIndex]` (`FalloutSave.PluginForModIndex`); the
inventory surfaces it as a friendly name (`PluginNames.Friendly` → `FriendlySourceForModIndex`). FO3/FNV
plugins have **no content-name field** — the TES4 header is only author/masters/overrides, and the DLC
names survive merely incidentally in gameplay `MESG` records (no consistent EDID/FormID), so the in-game
"Downloadable Content" menu uses the engine's built-in known-content list. We mirror that: a small table
maps the 10 official files to their exact menu names (Fallout: New Vegas, Dead Money, Gun Runners'
Arsenal, …), with a PascalCase-split fallback for any other mod.

**Mod Organizer 2 saves.** Modded setups (e.g. Viva New Vegas) run under MO2, which keeps each mod's
files in `<root>\mods\<Mod>\` and only merges them into `Data` via a virtual filesystem *at launch* — so
the mod plugins aren't physically in the game `Data` folder and their item names won't resolve. When a
save is loaded from an MO2 profile (`<root>\profiles\<profile>\saves\`), `GameDataLocator.FindMo2Mods`
derives `<root>\mods` from the path, and `PluginDatabase.CollectPlugins` indexes both the `Data` folder
(base/DLC, authoritative) and each `mods\<Mod>\` root (one VNV save went from 10/43 → 43/43 plugins
resolved). Large modded inventories used to mis-decode (the item run is split by big per-stack extra-data
blocks, and a non-item run elsewhere in the record was longer) — fixed by the wider window + distinct-ref
run selection in §4g (that VNV Courier save went from 0/127 named stacks to 105/110: Lead, caps,
reloading components, …).

**Pip-Boy category (which tab an item appears under).** The tab is **not stored in the save** — it is a
pure function of the base form's **record type**, which `TesPlugin` already reads (the GRUP signature) but
used to discard. `PluginDatabase` now keeps the type per FormID and exposes `RecordType(formId)` +
`Category(formId)` via `PipBoyTab(recordType)` (CLI `inventory` shows a `[Tab/TYPE]` column). Mapping,
**verified in-game on a VNV save:** `WEAP`→Weapons, `ARMO`→Apparel, `AMMO`→Ammo; `ALCH` **and** `BOOK`→Aid
(Aid = "single-use with an effect": food/chems/stimpaks + skill *magazines* (timed, `ALCH`) + skill *books*
(permanent, `BOOK`, e.g. "Duck and Cover!")); `NOTE`→Pip-Boy *Data → Notes* (not an item tab, §6.5);
everything else→Misc (`MISC`, `CMNY`, `CCRD`/`CDCK`, `CHIP`, `IMOD`, and **keys** `KEYM` — the Pip-Boy
collapses all keys into one **"Keyring"** pseudo-row, a UI grouping not stored in the save).

### 4i. Per-stack extra data (condition / equipped / mods) — the deterministic inventory walk
The inventory decoder is now **deterministic**: there is no 2048-byte scan window. Each stack is the fixed
9-byte `[ref:3 BE][7C][count:u32 LE][7C]` entry followed by a per-stack **extra-data block** whose exact byte
length is computed from its decoded properties, so the walk advances to the next stack precisely. Layout:
```
[a:u8][7C]                          a == 0x00  -> no extra data (block is 2 bytes)
[a=04:u8][7C][b:u8][7C] props…      a == 0x04  -> b/4 typed properties follow
property = [type:u8][7C] [payload][7C]   (the trailing [7C] only when the payload is non-empty)
```
Property type → payload catalog (**confirmed by a controlled 3-save diff** — vanilla Saves 31/32/33: equip a
9mm pistol then repair it with a Weapon Repair Kit):
- `0x25` **ExtraCondition** — 4-byte LE float = the item's **absolute current health** (NOT a 0–100 %). The repair
  moved exactly this float `52.5 → 67.5`; it appears only on degradable gear. Values differ per item (real save:
  9mm Pistol 45, SMG 205, Metal Armor 497.2, Grenade Rifle 99.9); the **max is the base-form Health** stat, not
  yet decoded — see §6 #11. **Editable** as a same-length splice (`TrySetItemCondition`).
- `0x16` **ExtraEquipped** — 0-byte flag; its presence means the stack is equipped/worn. It *appeared* on the
  pistol when equipped (Save 31→32), and is present on the always-worn Pip-Boy / worn armor.
- `0x21` — a 3-byte BE refID. On a weapon this is an attached **weapon mod**; the type is reused for other
  linked refs (a VNV "Bill of Sale" note appears on a consumable), so the general semantics aren't pinned.
- `0x6E` (0-byte flag), `0x1C` (3-byte refID), `0x24` (2-byte value), `0x30` (4-byte float) — **payload lengths
  now pinned by corpus alignment** (see "Per-stack property sizing" below); sized but semantics unlabelled.
- `0x0D` — **structured/variable, now DECODED** (sized). It is `[0D][7C][ref:3 BE][7C][n:u8][7C]` then `n/4`
  `[u32:4][7C][f64:8][7C]` pairs then two fixed `[00][7C]` fields, so its length is **`12 + 14·(n/4)`** — pinned by
  corpus alignment (recovered lengths were exactly 12, 26, 54, 68, 110 … for 0/1/3/4/7 pairs across all 607 saves).
  `ReferenceChangeForm.VariablePropertyLength` sizes it and `TryReadStackExtra` now walks straight through it; the
  ≤512-byte resync is retired to a never-hit safety net (semantics stay unlabelled per "size, don't guess").

The list **start** is now anchored by `changeFlags` and a sized preamble, not by ranking every run in the
record. The walk (`ReferenceChangeForm.InventorySearchStart` + `FalloutSave.WalkInventory`) skips **two
deterministic sections** before scanning:
1. the `changeFlags`-gated 27-byte **MOVE** block (`CHANGE_REFR_MOVE`, bit 1 — cell ref + position + rotation), then
2. a **fixed 1160-byte havok/float array** — exactly **232** `[u32][7C]` delimited slots (mostly the reference's
   zeroed havok/animation arrays, but **some slots cache actor values** — slots 100/101 are the player's karma/XP,
   §4j). This size is an **empirical invariant** across all 30 real saves (both characters,
   fresh→4 h) and is **independent of bit 22** (flags `0xB0400832` and `0xB0000832` land identically), so it is a
   structural skip, not a scan. `InventorySearchStart` validates the exact 232-slot shape before skipping (a
   delimiter at every 5th byte) and falls back to just-past-MOVE otherwise, so it can never mis-skip.

That lands on the reference's own **ExtraDataList**, which is now **sized too** — so the start is reached with
**no forward scan and no distinct-ref acceptance test**. The ExtraDataList is a fixed-shape typed list, decoded by
aligning all 30 real saves (`ReferenceChangeForm.TryInventoryItemsStart`):
```
[00][7C][scale:f32][7C]                      reference header (a flags byte + a 1.0 scale)
[xx][7C][5E][7C][N*4][7C] N×(ref:3 7C flag:1 7C)   ExtraDataList ref-list (N = byte/4 entries)
[18][7C][ref:3][7C][pos:3×f32][7C][rot:f32][7C]    fixed 24-byte block (identical bytes on every save)
[74][7C][ref:3][7C]                          a linked-ref entry
([60][7C][u32][7C])                          OPTIONAL — present only on large inventories
[stackCount : vsval][7C]                     Bethesda variable-size value: low 2 bits = byte width, value >> 2
item stacks…
```
The clincher is the **`vsval` stack count** immediately before the items: a variable-size integer whose value is
the number of item stacks (Save 31 → `0x90` → **36**; quicksave → `0x0181` → **96**; the late save → **88**).
`WalkInventory` reads it and decodes from the computed offset, accepting only when at least that many stacks
follow — a **self-validating** anchor that replaces the heuristic entirely on the deterministic path. The old
whole-record byte scan + global most-distinct-chain ranking is **gone**, and so is the per-ExtraDataList forward
scan. **Verified:** the deterministic path is taken on **all 30 real saves** (none fall back), the `inventory`
output is **byte-identical** to the prior decoder (diffed across all 30), and the vsval count equals the decoded
stack count on **28/30** (on quicksave + the 88-stack save the decoder over-reads two interspersed non-item stacks
that name-resolution already hides — see §9; the vsval *reveals* this but Core can't drop them without the
masters, so the full chain is kept rather than truncated, which would drop real trailing items). 283 tests green,
incl. real-save tests pinning the start at `dataOffset + MOVE + 1 + 1160` and `0 ≤ decoded − vsval`. Tooling:
`ReferenceChangeForm` (`InventorySearchStart`, `GatedArrayBlockLength`, `ReadVsval`, `TryInventoryItemsStart`,
`TryReadStackExtra`) + CLI `refdump` (prints the `changeFlags` bits, the MOVE + fixed-array spans, and the sized
ExtraDataList → first item + vsval count).
**The modded grammar — now LIVE, deterministic on all 607 real saves.** The fixed vanilla parse above was
vanilla-specific; it is now generalised into the **live decoder** so the modded list start is deterministic too —
**vanilla 30/30, base VNV 98/98, VNV Extended 479/479** (the §4g forward scan in §4g is retained only as an
unused safety net). `TryInventoryItemsStart` walks the ExtraDataList as a **general typed-entry sequence** via the
shared `ReferenceChangeForm.ExtraEntryLength` catalog (any order, incl. the modded types), terminating on the
inventory `vsval` — recognised by it being a sane count (`ReadVsval` ≤ `MaxInventoryStacks`) immediately followed
by a structurally-valid stack (`LooksLikeStackStart`). The grammar, **pinned by aligning all 479 + the 30 vanilla**:
```
[00][7C][scale:f32][7C]   reference header (7 bytes)
[xx][7C]                  ExtraDataList lead byte (a flag/count; meaning unpinned)
( [type:u8][7C][payload] )*   typed entries, VARIABLE ORDER — catalog (entry length incl. the [type][7C]):
    0x18 = 24            ref + position + rotation block
    0x74 = 6             a linked-ref entry
    0x5E = 4 + 6·N       ref-list, N = b/4, each sub-entry (ref:3 7C flag:1 7C)
    0x60 = 7             a u32 entry (large inventories)
    0x1D = 4 + 4·N       NEW (modded): sub ref-list, N = b/4, each sub-entry (ref:3 7C) — no flag byte
    0x75 = 12            NEW (modded): a 2-ref entry, [75][7C][ref:3][7C][ref:3][7C][flag:1][7C]
[stackCount : vsval][7C]  the terminator — its value lands EXACTLY on the first item (self-validating)
item stacks…
```
The three corpora form a clear progression: **vanilla** order is always `5E,18,74` (+ optional `60`); **base VNV**
keeps the `5E`-first order but **adds** the modded `0x1D`/`0x75` types; **VNV Extended** additionally **reorders**
to `18,74,5E,…`. The live typed-entry walk handles all of these directly. Two further structural facts that the
vanilla path assumed turned out to be Extended-specific — each now closed:

1. **Variable post-entry tail (the `0x04/0x14/0x15` ref-lists).** A handful of saves carry, after the recognised
   entries and before the vsval, an extra group (`7C 7C 04 7C [ref:3] 7C`, large-endgame `7C 7C 14 7C [ref:3…]`,
   or `7C 7C 15 [n] 7C [ref…]`). These are inconsistently framed (a count byte in `0x15`, none in `0x14`) so they
   aren't individually sized; instead `TryInventoryItemsStart` does a **bounded resync** (`PostEntryResyncWindow`)
   forward to the self-validating vsval. **Closed.**
2. **The pre-list region on bit2/bit10 records is NOT a sized slot array — it's a variable-length Havok physics
   blob.** Some records set `changeFlags` bit2 (`CHANGE_REFR_HAVOK_MOVE`) and/or bit10, and the region
   between MOVE and the ExtraDataList is then **active physics state**, not the vanilla 232-slot `[u32][7C]` array
   (the "~214 slots" first guess was wrong). **It is situational, not a "late-game" rule** (see §6 #12): present
   **only in VNV Extended** (113 records) and **absent from base VNV — even at level 31 / 39 h — and vanilla**;
   within Extended it appears on *some* later/auto/quick saves but not on others at the same level (L16–18 manual
   saves lack it), consistent with the player reference being in active Havok sim at the moment of saving.
   **Grammar now confirmed by corpus alignment over all 113 bit2/bit10
   records (VNV Extended ONLY — base VNV + vanilla have zero):** a **7-byte preamble** `[u16][7C][u8][7C][u8][7C]`
   (two families seen: `E1 10 7C 04 7C 4C 7C` and `49 11 7C 05 7C 4C 7C`), then **N × 58-byte entries**
   `[pos:3×f32][7C][quat:4×f32][7C][03][7C][vel:3×f32][7C][angvel:3×f32][7C]` (delimiters at offsets 12/29/31/44/57,
   type `0x03` at 30 — `ReferenceChangeForm.HavokPhysicsEntryLength` recognises one, test-pinned), then a
   **truncated final entry** (pos+quat+`03` trailing into zeros), then a **variable trailing `[4][7C]` slot array**
   (the same vanilla actor-value/havok array) up to the ExtraDataList header. It is **genuinely variable-length** (6
   distinct blob lengths, scattered mod 5) and the trailing slot array's values **locally collide** with
   `IsExtraDataListHeader` (a slot whose high byte is `00` matches), so it **can't be byte-sized to a fixed stride
   and the list end can't be found by structure alone** — a sizer would *still* need self-validation at the tail.
   Rather than decode the physics, `FalloutSave.ScanForExtraDataListAnchor` locates the list by the
   **first ExtraDataList header that self-validates** (typed entries → sane vsval → real stack chain), and
   `WalkInventory` chooses the **real (longest) chain** between that anchor and the §4g scan (a 2× gap separates a
   genuine 180–214-stack endgame list from the short coincidental chains either locator can otherwise latch onto;
   neither locator alone suffices — the anchor finds lists the scan misses, and the scan finds the bit10 lists the
   anchor has no header for). **Closed — and it fixed 35 Extended endgame inventories that previously decoded to
   empty** (the §4g scan had been returning name-unresolvable garbage from the havok blob, hidden by the name
   filter). The blob's exact byte decode is a logged follow-up (not needed for the list).

**Per-stack property sizing — four more pinned (now `0x16/0x21/0x25/0x6E/0x1C/0x24/0x30`).** Beyond the original
`0x25/0x16/0x21`, four further per-stack property types had their **payload length** pinned **structurally by a
corpus-alignment measurement** (the structural analogue of §7's controlled diff — no new in-game saves): CLI
`edlscan` histograms, per unsized type, the byte gap from the property's `[type][7C]` header to the next valid
stack, cleanest when the property is the block's **last** one (block ends → next stack, so `payload = gap==2 ? 0
: gap-3`). Each spiked at a single gap across the corpus, so the length is fixed (semantics stay unlabelled, per
"size, don't guess" — exactly as `0x21` was sized before its meaning was known):
- `0x6E` — **0-byte flag** (gap 2 on **929/929**; modded weapons)
- `0x1C` — **3-byte BE refID** (gap 6 on **108/108**)
- `0x24` — **2-byte value** (gap 5 on **1163/1169**; a `0x25` condition often follows it)
- `0x30` — **4-byte LE float** (gap 7 as last / 12 with a trailing `0x24`; a ~0.82 value)

Added to `ReferenceChangeForm.FixedPropertyPayload`, so the per-stack walk now decodes these blocks deterministically
instead of resyncing. **Bonus correctness win:** because the walk no longer scans forward over these blocks (where
the old resync occasionally latched onto a coincidental stack-like pattern *inside* the extra data), it **drops
phantom over-read stacks** — 11 modded saves moved closer to / exactly onto their `vsval` count (e.g. base VNV
Save 34: decoded 145 → **141 = vsval exactly**; every changed save decreased, **0 became under-read**). Pinned in
`ReferenceChangeFormTests`.

**`0x0D` — the last per-stack type — is now DECODED (sized), so *every* observed per-stack type is sized and the
≤512 B resync is retired to a never-hit safety net.** `0x0D` is structured, not single-fixed-length: `[0D][7C]`
`[ref:3 BE][7C]` `[n:u8][7C]` then `n/4` `[u32:4][7C][f64:8][7C]` pairs then two fixed `[00][7C]` fields. Its total
length is **`12 + 14·(n/4)`**, pinned by **corpus alignment**: a boundary recovery (anchoring on the known-sized
properties that *follow* the `0x0D` inside the same block — the `LooksLikeStackStart` gap is unreliable because
`0x0D`'s own payload contains stack-looking bytes) measured recovered lengths of exactly 12, 26, 54, 68, 110 … for
0/1/3/4/7 pairs across **all 607 saves** — a clean `12 + 14k` progression. `ReferenceChangeForm.VariablePropertyLength`
sizes it; `TryReadStackExtra` walks straight through it (semantics unlabelled per "size, don't guess"). **Correctness:**
over-read **strictly decreased on every corpus with 0 under-reads** (vanilla 2 saves/+4 → **0/+0**; base VNV 8/+35 → 4/+12;
Extended 318/+448 → 314/+393), **and** condition/equipped extra-data that the old resync *dropped* when it sat after a
`0x0D` is now **recovered** — verified on VNV Extended Save 116, where "Legion Recruit Armor" now correctly shows
`cond 117 [equipped]` (the only change in an otherwise byte-identical name-filtered inventory). Pinned in
`ReferenceChangeFormTests` + a real-save theory asserting no decoded stack carries an unsized type.

Tooling: CLI `refdump` prints the typed-entry ExtraDataList walk (flagging the first unrecognised type + a raw
window); **`edlscan <dir>`** aggregates the grammar + the per-save deterministic-path tally + the
`vsval`-vs-decoded over/under-read tally; **`invsig <dir>`** prints a per-save decoded-inventory signature for
byte-identical-decode checks across decoder changes (used with `git stash` to diff before/after).
`PlayerInventory.DeterministicStart` records, per save, whether the start was located deterministically.

### 4j. Player karma + XP — two floats in the player reference's actor-value array
The fixed array between the MOVE block and the ExtraDataList (the "232-slot havok/float array" of §4i) is **not**
all zeroed havok state — specific slots cache the player reference's **actor values**. Two of them are the
player's **karma** and **experience points**, stored as adjacent little-endian **float32** `[f32][7C]` slots in
the player **reference** change form (the iref = PlayerRef + 1 record — the same record that carries the
inventory, §4g):
```
… [karma : f32][7C] [xp : f32][7C] …      array slot 100 = karma, slot 101 = XP (0-indexed, 5 bytes/slot)
```
**Cracked by a controlled diff via the new `fdiff` helper.** A scalar like XP/karma is a float, and a float
change (e.g. `100.0 → 150.0`) only alters its high bytes — the low bytes stay `00` — so it never surfaces as a
clean byte-run delta in `diff`/`idiff` (this is why the first pass found nothing). `fdiff <a> <b> [delta]` aligns
change forms by FormID (like `idiff`) and reads the **full 4 bytes** at every offset of each same-length record,
reporting offsets whose float32 changed by ≈`delta`. On the controlled pairs it pinned a single field in each
case: **XP** `10→60→110` (vanilla Saves 33/34/35, `rewardxp 50` twice) at slot 101, **karma** `0→100→200` (Saves
35/36/37, `rewardkarma 100` twice) at slot 100. The two are **cross-stable** (XP unchanged across the karma saves
and vice-versa), and the **slot indices were confirmed on a second character** (Mace Windu: karma 35, XP 338 —
both sane), so they're structural, not character-specific.

**Locator (`ReferenceChangeForm.PlayerStatSlotOffset`):** skip the gated 27-byte MOVE block, require the full
vanilla 232-slot delimited array (which guarantees the slot is a real `[f32][7C]` and **excludes** the bit2/bit10
havok-physics records whose pre-list region isn't a slot array — there it declines, returning null karma/XP, the
graceful path like the SPECIAL/skills locators), then index the slot. `FalloutSave.Karma`/`Xp` read it,
`TrySetKarma`/`TrySetXp` edit it as same-length float splices (karma may be negative). Surfaced in CLI
(`karma`/`xp`/`setkarma`/`setxp`) and the GUI Edit tab. **Verified:** reads match the controlled deltas exactly on
all six pairs + the second character; edits round-trip same-length. Tooling: CLI **`fdiff`** (§7).

> **Note:** only two slots of this actor-value array are decoded so far. The rest (and the array's per-slot
> meaning generally) stay labelled as the undecoded havok/float array — more controlled diffs can graduate
> further slots (e.g. carry weight, action points) the same way.

### 4k. Player read notes — the Pip-Boy "Data → Notes" viewed markers
The notes the player has **read/viewed** (Pip-Boy *Data → Notes*, shown in normal font; unread ones are bold)
are recorded **one change form per read note**. Reading a note makes the engine write a tiny, zero-payload
change form on the note's inventory reference:
```
[refID : 3 bytes BE]   the note's inventory reference = FormID-array index + 1 (the §4g convention)
[changeFlags : 0x80000000]   the "read" marker (no other bits)
[type : 0x1F]          form-type 0x1F; high 2 bits 0 -> the length field is one byte
[version : 0x1B]
[length : 0]           NO payload — the marker's mere presence is the read state
```
The note's own FormID is therefore `FormIdArray[refID - 1]`, which resolves to a **`NOTE`** record (named via
the masters, §4h). **Cracked by a controlled in-game diff** (VNV Extended Saves 491→492: hover one inventory
note to mark it read): `idiff` showed **exactly one inserted change form** — `iref 54137 → 0x0014068C, type
0x1F, flags 0x80000000, len 0` — against a backdrop of pure game-time-stamp churn; the note it named via the
`-1` index was **"Recipes - Rose's Wasteland Omelet"**, the note that was read. Verified across the whole save:
**all 171 markers resolve to `NOTE` records via the `-1` index (171/171)**, and the count moved 170 → 171 with
the single read. Sane counts on vanilla too (a fresh Goodsprings save = 0; a played save names "How To Play
Caravan", "Mojave Express Delivery Order (6 of 6)", …).

**Corpus-confirmed across all three corpora** (`notescan <dir>`, §4k.1 #1–#3 — the `0x80000000` flag, the
`type 0x1F`→`NOTE` resolution, and the `+1` convention): of **45,783** `type 0x1F` markers (vanilla 20 + base VNV
1,551 + VNV Extended 44,212), the `changeFlags` is **always exactly `0x80000000`** (one distinct value) and
**every** marker resolves via the `−1` index to a `NOTE` (**0 non-NOTE / 0 unknown / 0 invalid**) — the earlier
"non-NOTE collisions" were a masters-remap artifact, gone once the `PluginDatabase` is built **per distinct load
order**. On Save 492 the read note sits at FormID-array iref 54136 and its marker's `refID` is iref **54137 =
54136 + 1** (the `+1` proven); the marker's own `refID` form (`0x0014068C`) is a *reference object*, distinct from
the note, and the note need **not** be currently carried (0/45,783 markers point at a held inventory stack). Pinned
in real-save tests.

**Decode is read-only.** The marker is a whole change form, so toggling read/unread is a **length-changing**
edit (add/remove a record + a FormID-array entry — deferred, §6.7), not a same-length splice; we surface the
list but don't edit it. `FalloutSave.ReadNotes` enumerates the markers (`type 0x1F`, `changeFlags 0x80000000`,
`len 0`) into `PlayerNotes`/`NoteEntry`; CLI `notes` and the GUI **Notes** tab resolve the names. **Scope:** the
save records *read* notes only — a note that's been **acquired but never opened leaves no marker**, so the
acquired-unread set (e.g. a bold "They Didn't Shoot The Deputy") is not surfaced by `ReadNotes`. That list has now
been **located** (a controlled triple, Saves 38→39→40): it is a `7C`-delimited ref-list **inside the player
inventory change form**, not a global table — see §4k.1 #4 for the structure and the decoder still to ship.

### 4k.1. Notes — decode worklist (✅ COMPLETE — items 1–7 all closed)
The notes system is now **fully understood**: the read list (§4k), the marker semantics (#1–#3, corpus-proven over
45,783 markers), the **full Pip-Boy list incl. unread** (#4, decoder shipped), the read/bold mechanism (#5), the
base-form metadata incl. holodisk-vs-text (#6), and the game-time-stamp churn (#7, suppression tool). What the
**save** stores about notes is exactly two things: which notes are held (refs in the player inventory record) and
which are read (`type 0x1F` markers); everything else is read from the masters. **Method throughout: a controlled
diff (§7) — change one thing in-game, save before/after, diff.** History below.

*Used-but-not-truly-decoded (the marker works empirically; the semantics aren't pinned):*
- [x] **1. `changeFlags = 0x80000000` — is it ever combined with other bits?** ✅ **CLOSED by a corpus tally**
  (`notescan <dir>` over all three corpora): the read marker's `changeFlags` is **always exactly `0x80000000`** —
  a *single* distinct value across **45,783 markers** (vanilla 20 + base VNV 1,551 + VNV Extended 44,212), never
  combined with other change bits. So the `ReadNotes` filter can neither miss (a read note with extra bits) nor
  over-match. Pinned in a real-save test. (Which named CHANGE_ enum bit `0x80000000` is — likely a generic
  "form is initialised/active" high bit — is cosmetic now that the value is proven invariant.)
- [x] **2. `type = 0x1F` — is form-type `0x1F` exactly NOTE?** ✅ **CLOSED.** `notescan` enumerates *every*
  `type 0x1F` change form and resolves each via the `−1` index: **all 45,783 resolve to a `NOTE` record — 0
  non-NOTE, 0 unknown, 0 invalid.** The earlier "apparent non-NOTE collisions" were a **masters-remap artifact**:
  reusing one save's FormID remap for a different load order mis-resolves FormIDs. Building the `PluginDatabase`
  **per distinct load order** (5 in Extended) makes the non-NOTE tail vanish entirely. Pinned in a real-save test
  (`Real_saves_every_type_0x1F_change_form_is_a_read_note_marker`).
- [x] **3. What is the marker's own `refID` form, and is the `+1` the inventory-reference convention?** ✅
  **CLOSED (structurally).** Confirmed on Save 492: the note *"Recipes - Rose's Wasteland Omelet"* (`0x0013D52C`)
  sits at **FormID-array iref 54136**, and its read marker's `refID` is **iref 54137 = 54136 + 1** — the `+1`
  proven, and the `−1` index resolves **45,783/45,783** to `NOTE`. The marker's own `refID` resolves to a
  *distinct* form (`0x0014068C`) — a **reference object** (not the note's base form) that `TesPlugin` can't name
  because it indexes only item record types, not `REFR`. **Refinement:** the note is **not required to be in the
  player's current inventory** — `notescan` finds **0/45,783** markers whose note is a currently-held stack, and
  Save 492's note shows `inventory: (not carried)`. So `+1` is the **FormID-array** convention (note → its
  reference), and read state persists independent of carrying; the earlier "appears as an inventory entry at
  data+0x296BD" was the *reference bytes* in the record, not a held stack. *Remaining (low priority):* naming what
  the `refID` reference object (`0x0014068C`) actually is needs a `REFR`/CELL decode in `TesPlugin` — not needed
  for the read-notes list.

*Located by a controlled triple (Saves 38→39→40, Doc Mitchell's House: additem a note unread → open it):*
- [x] **4. Acquired-but-unread notes list — ✅ DONE (decoder shipped).** The acquired-notes
  list is **not** a global-data table (the table 9/10 / quest-form guesses were **wrong**) — it is a **`7C`-delimited
  ref-list embedded in the player inventory change form** (iref = PlayerRef + 1; iref 368 here — the same record as
  item stacks §4g, but a **separate sub-list** within its ExtraDataList, which is why the §4g/§4i item-stack decoder
  never surfaces notes). **Decisively traced:** `player.additem 00117E37 1` (Philippe's Recipes), unread →
  `idiff`/`find`/`hex`:
  - **Acquire (38→39):** FormID array `+1` = the note **base form** (`0x00117E37` @ iref 8151); the note's 3-byte
    refID (`00 1F D8` = 8152 = base index + 1) is **inserted into the ref-list** inside the player inventory record
    (iref 368, at data+0x102D — absent in 38, present in 39), with a neighbouring count byte bumped. **No change form,
    no read marker.** ⇒ acquired/bold = *present in this ref-list*.
  - **Read (39→40):** FormID array `+1` = the note's **inventory-reference object** (`0x00024F80` @ iref 8152,
    **adjacent** to the base form) **and** `+1` change form = the **`type 0x1F` read marker** (`changeFlags
    0x80000000`, len 0) on that reference. ⇒ read/non-bold = *a marker now exists*.
  This also **proves the `+1` convention exactly (§4k.1 #3):** the base form (N) and its inventory-reference object
  (N+1) are **consecutive** FormID-array entries; the read marker's refID is N+1, so note = `array[(N+1)−1]
  = array[N]`. **✅ DECODER SHIPPED:** `FalloutSave.PipBoyNotes(isNoteForm)` scans the player inventory change form
  for `7C`-delimited 3-byte refIDs whose `FormIdArray[ref−1]` is a `NOTE` (the caller injects the masters test —
  `Core` stays UI-agnostic, mirroring inventory name resolution), unions them with the read markers, and flags each
  `Read` (a marker exists) vs **unread**. CLI `notes` and the GUI **Notes** tab now show the **full** list with a
  read/unread status. **Verified:** on the triple, Save 38 = 1 unread (the courier's starting delivery order), Save
  39 = +Philippe's Recipes **unread**, Save 40 = Philippe's **read**; on the modded Save 492, **197 notes (171 read +
  26 unread)**, all named, no false positives — and the unread set includes *"They Didn't Shoot The Deputy"*, the
  very note this checklist cited as an unrepresented bold/unread example. Real-save + synthetic tests pin it.
  *(Open: the exact byte framing of the ref-list — a `[count][7C] N×(ref:3 7C)` shape — isn't individually parsed;
  the scan finds note refs directly, which is robust to framing. Confirming a world-pickup behaves like `additem`
  is a nice-to-have, not required — the scan keys on the note reference, however it was acquired.)*
- [◑] **5. Inventory-side read/bold state — ANSWERED.** Bold→non-bold is **not** a per-stack item flag (§4i catalog).
  Reading writes the **`type 0x1F` read-marker change form** on the note's inventory-reference object (created on
  read, #4 above); the note's *membership* in the Pip-Boy Notes list is its presence in the acquired-notes ref-list,
  and its *read* state is the marker's presence. (Aside: in Save 40 the user noted that *selecting* the note set both
  the "selected/active" indicator **and** the read state; the read marker is the read half — a separate
  "currently-selected note" field, if persisted, is buried in the game-time-stamp churn, #7, and wasn't isolated.)
- [x] **6. Note metadata — ✅ DONE (nothing else is in the *save*).** The controlled triple is conclusive: acquiring
  a note wrote **only** a FormID-array entry + the ref-list entry, and reading wrote **only** the reference object +
  marker — **no text, media type, sort key, or "new" flag** is ever copied into the save. So every other note
  attribute is a pure function of the **base form** (read from the masters, §4h): the **name** (`FULL`), the **text**
  (`TNAM`/linked terminal), the **Pip-Boy sort/category** (always the *Notes* sub-tab, §4h), and the **"new"/bold
  indicator** (= the read state, already decoded #5). Concretely shipped: the **holodisk-vs-text** distinction now
  surfaces — `TesPlugin` reads the `NOTE` `DATA` media byte (0=Sound,1=Text,2=Image,3=Voice) and
  `PluginDatabase.NoteMediaType` exposes it; CLI `notes` + the GUI Notes tab show a **Type** column. Verified on Save
  492 (text journals → *Text*, "Justice Bloc HQ Security Tapes" → *Voice*); unit-tested.
- [x] **7. The game-time-stamp "noise" — ✅ ADDRESSED (suppression tool; characterised).** The ~3,300 same-length
  record changes that swamp a notes diff are **per-reference game-time / havok updates** in `REFR` change forms: each
  save rewrites a few fields — some are globally-identical stamps (e.g. `25 6A→33 BB`, `9E 02 FC→B4 1B FD`) written
  into *every* reference, others are per-reference position/time floats. Rather than byte-decode each field (low
  value), `idiff <a> <b> clean` **auto-subtracts** them: it tallies each byte-run's old→new value across all records
  and hides a record when every run is either a globally-recurring stamp or sits adjacent to one (same churn
  cluster); insertions/removals/length-changes and off-cluster runs always show. On the notes triple this collapses
  **3,314 → 11** (A→B) and surfaces the inserted read marker cleanly (B→C). *(The exact float semantics of each stamp
  remain undecoded — not needed; the filter is value-independent.)*

Tooling (now committed in the CLI): **`notescan <dir>`** aggregates the read-note markers across a save folder —
the `changeFlags`-value tally (#1), the `type 0x1F` → record-type tally via the `−1` index with a per-distinct-
load-order `PluginDatabase` (#2), and the inventory-reference cross-check (#3); **`resolve <save> <formId>`** is a
one-shot lookup (record type + name + source plugin, and where the FormID appears — FormID array iref / inventory
/ read-note marker). Both sit behind the existing `PluginDatabase`/`EnumerateChangeForms`. These closed #1–#3.

| Mod Organizer 2 / modded saves (§4h) | ✅ auto-detects the MO2 `mods\` folder from an MO2 save path; a 43-plugin Viva New Vegas save resolves 43/43; large fragmented inventories reunited (a dropped 1,414-count stack recovered) |
| Pip-Boy item category / tab (§4h) | ✅ from the base form's record type (read from the masters, not the save): `RecordType`/`Category`/`PipBoyTab`; verified in-game (WEAP/ARMO/AMMO; ALCH+BOOK→Aid; KEYM→Misc/"Keyring"; NOTE→Data) |
| Caps decode + edit (§6.4) | ✅ caps are an inventory stack (FormID `0x0000000F`); `Caps`/`TrySetCaps` wrap the inventory path; CLI `caps`/`setcaps` + GUI Edit field; same-length edit round-trips |
| Karma + XP decode + edit (§4j) | ✅ two float32 actor-values in the player reference record (slot 100 = karma, slot 101 = XP), cracked via the new `fdiff` float-aware diff on controlled pairs (XP `10→60→110`, karma `0→100→200`) + confirmed on a 2nd character; `Karma`/`Xp` + `TrySetKarma`/`TrySetXp`; CLI `karma`/`xp`/`setkarma`/`setxp` + GUI; same-length float edit round-trips |
| Read notes decode (§4k) | ✅ Pip-Boy *Data → Notes* "viewed" markers — one zero-payload change form per read note (`type 0x1F`, `changeFlags 0x80000000`, `len 0`) on the note's inventory reference (FormID-array index + 1); note = `FormIdArray[refID-1]` → `NOTE`. Cracked by a controlled diff (Saves 491→492: one note read = **+1 change form**, "Recipes - Rose's Wasteland Omelet"); **all 171 markers resolve to NOTE (171/171)**. `ReadNotes`/`PlayerNotes`; CLI `notes` + GUI Notes tab. **Read-only** (the marker is a whole change form → toggling is length-changing, §6.7) |
| Read-note marker semantics — corpus-confirmed (§4k.1 #1–#3) | ✅ `notescan <dir>` over all three corpora (**45,783** `type 0x1F` markers): `changeFlags` **always exactly `0x80000000`** (one value), **every** marker resolves via the `−1` index to a `NOTE` (**0 non-NOTE/unknown/invalid** — the old "collisions" were a masters-remap artifact, fixed by a per-load-order `PluginDatabase`), and the `+1` convention is proven (Save 492: note iref 54136 → marker refID 54137). New CLI `notescan`/`resolve`; pinned in real-save tests |
| Full Pip-Boy notes — read **and** unread (§4k.1 #4) | ✅ `FalloutSave.PipBoyNotes` scans the player inventory change form's note ref-list for refs resolving to `NOTE` records (masters test injected by the caller) ∪ the read markers; flags each read/unread. Cracked by the Saves 38→39→40 controlled triple (additem a note unread → read it). CLI `notes` + GUI Notes tab show the full list with status; Save 492 = 197 notes (171 read + 26 unread, incl. the bold "They Didn't Shoot The Deputy"), no false positives. Read-only (toggling is length-changing, §6.7); real-save + synthetic tests |
| Note metadata — holodisk-vs-text + base-form attributes (§4k.1 #6) | ✅ proven nothing else is stored per-save (the controlled triple wrote only refs + markers); `TesPlugin` reads the `NOTE` `DATA` media byte, `PluginDatabase.NoteMediaType` → Text/Voice/Sound/Image, surfaced in CLI `notes` + GUI Type column (Save 492: text journals → Text, "Justice Bloc HQ Security Tapes" → Voice); unit-tested |
| Game-time-stamp churn suppression (§4k.1 #7) | ✅ `idiff … clean` auto-hides the recurring per-reference game-time/havok churn (value-frequency + adjacency clustering), collapsing the notes diff 3,314 → 11 and surfacing the inserted read marker; characterised as per-`REFR` time/havok float updates |
| WPF GUI (metadata, screenshot, plugins, stats, SPECIAL + skills + inventory + caps + karma/XP edit + full notes read/unread + media type) | ✅ launches + builds |
| `diff` tool (pinpoints same-size changes) | ✅ Strength 5→6 = 1 byte; `cf` mode names the containing change form; `idiff` aligns records across an insertion, `idiff … clean` hides game-time churn (§4k.1 #7) |
| Tests | ✅ 725 xUnit, all green |
| Per-stack `0x0D` extra-data decode (§4i) | ✅ the last unsized per-stack type, sized by corpus alignment: `[0D][7C][ref:3][7C][n:u8][7C]` + `n/4` `[u32][f64]` pairs + two fixed fields = `12 + 14·(n/4)` (lengths 12/26/54/68/110 across all 607 saves). `VariablePropertyLength`; over-read strictly ↓ (vanilla 2→0, base 8→4, ext 318→314, **0 under-reads**) + recovers condition/equipped that the old resync dropped after a `0x0D`. ≤512 B resync now a never-hit safety net |
| Deterministic inventory decoder + condition edit (§4i) | ✅ window removed; condition (`0x25`) editable + equipped/`0x21` surfaced in CLI + GUI; condition edit round-trips |
| Deterministic inventory list *start* (§4i) | ✅ **deterministic on all 607 real saves** (vanilla 30/30, base VNV 98/98, VNV Extended 479/479): MOVE-skip + the typed-entry ExtraDataList walk (variable order + modded `0x1D`/`0x75`) + bounded post-entry resync + the **ExtraDataList-header anchor** for bit2/bit10 havok-physics records → the **`vsval` stack count** → first item. The §4g scan is now an unused safety net. vsval self-validates (decoded ≥ vsval, **0 under-reads**); verified **display byte-identical** across all 607 except **35 endgame inventories this *fixed* (empty → full)** |
| Modded inventory start — **deterministic on all 3 corpora** (§4i) | ✅ the typed-entry walk is now the **live decoder**: variable-order entries (`0x18/0x74/0x5E/0x60` + modded `0x1D`/`0x75`) + bounded post-entry resync + the **ExtraDataList-header anchor scan** for bit2/bit10 `CHANGE_REFR_HAVOK_MOVE` records (whose pre-list region is a variable-length Havok physics blob, not a sized slot array) + a `vsval` sanity cap. Deterministic list start on **vanilla 30/30, base VNV 98/98, VNV Extended 479/479**; the §4g scan is now an unused safety net. **0 under-reads**; display **byte-identical** across all 607 except **35 VNV Extended endgame inventories that this *fixed* from decoding-empty → full** (the §4g scan had latched onto havok-blob garbage). New: `PlayerInventory.DeterministicStart`, CLI `invsig` (decode-signature cross-check). 347 tests green |

**Editable today:** level, save number, name (same-length), Misc Stats, full SPECIAL, stored skill
modifications (§4e), inventory stack counts (§4g), **item condition/health (§4i)**, **caps (§6.4 — the
`0x0000000F` stack)**, **karma + XP (§4j)** — all safe same-length splices.

## 6. Next steps (in priority order)

> ### ✅ DONE (was ★ ACTIVE) — deterministic inventory decoder + per-stack extra data (§4i)
>
> The 2048-byte scan window is **gone**. The per-stack extra-data block is decoded, so each stack's exact
> length is known and the walk advances deterministically (`FalloutSave.WalkInventory`/`AdvancePastStack` +
> `ReferenceChangeForm.TryReadStackExtra`). The extra-data **type→length catalog** was cracked by a controlled
> 3-save diff (vanilla 31/32/33: equip a 9mm pistol, then repair it): `0x25` = condition float (**editable**,
> 52.5→67.5), `0x16` = equipped flag, `0x21` = a ref (weapon mod on weapons); structured/mod-added types fall
> back to a bounded 512-byte resync. Surfaced + editable in CLI (`inventory`, `setcondition`) and GUI. New
> R&D microscope: CLI `refdump`.
>
> **✅ Done (the deterministic *start*):** the whole-record byte scan, the global most-distinct-chain ranking,
> **and the per-ExtraDataList forward scan + distinct-ref acceptance** are all **gone** on the deterministic path.
> `ReferenceChangeForm.InventorySearchStart` skips the 27-byte MOVE block + the **fixed 1160-byte havok array**
> (232 `[u32][7C]` slots, shape-validated), then `ReferenceChangeForm.TryInventoryItemsStart` sizes the whole
> **ExtraDataList** (header + `0x5E` ref-list of `N=byte/4` + a fixed 24-byte `0x18` block + a `0x74` entry +
> optional `0x60`) and reads the inventory's **`vsval` stack count** to land on the first item. `WalkInventory`
> decodes from there and accepts when ≥ that many stacks follow — the count **self-validates** the start.
> **Verified:** deterministic path taken on **all 30 saves** (zero fall-backs), `inventory` output **byte-identical**
> to the prior decoder, vsval = decoded count on 28/30 (the two outliers over-read two non-item stacks that name
> resolution hides — §9). Tests pin the start at `MOVE+1+1160` and `0 ≤ decoded − vsval`. `refdump` prints the
> sized ExtraDataList → first item + the vsval count.
>
> **✅ DONE (the modded start, all three corpora).** The typed-entry walk is now the **live decoder** and the
> item-list start is located **deterministically on all 607 real saves** — vanilla **30/30**, base VNV **98/98**,
> VNV Extended **479/479** (the §4g scan is retained only as an unused safety net). Three mechanisms closed the
> three gaps: (1) `TryInventoryItemsStart` walks the **variable-order** typed entries via the shared
> `ExtraEntryLength` catalog (incl. modded `0x1D`/`0x75`), terminating on the inventory `vsval` recognised by a
> following structurally-valid stack (`LooksLikeStackStart`); (2) a **bounded resync** past the variable
> post-entry `0x04/0x14/0x15` ref-lists to that vsval; (3) for the **bit2/bit10 (`CHANGE_REFR_HAVOK_MOVE`)**
> records — whose pre-list region is a *variable-length Havok physics blob* that can't be byte-sized, **not** a
> 214-slot array as first guessed — `FalloutSave.ScanForExtraDataListAnchor` finds the list by the **first
> ExtraDataList header that self-validates** (typed entries → sane `vsval` → real stack chain), and
> `WalkInventory` picks the **real (longest) chain** between that anchor and the §4g scan. A `vsval` sanity cap
> (`MaxInventoryStacks`) rejects wide-misread counts. **Unexpected win:** this *fixed 35 endgame VNV Extended
> inventories that previously decoded to empty* (the §4g scan had latched onto name-unresolvable garbage in the
> havok blob). Verified **0 under-reads** and **display byte-identical** across all 607 except those 35 strict
> corrections (`invsig` cross-check + per-save before/after diff). 347 tests green.
>
> **Logged follow-up (not a correctness risk):** the bit2/bit10 havok blob is *located past* but not *byte-decoded*
> — its exact serialization (preamble + ~58-byte `pos/quat/vel/[03]/vel/angvel` entries with `02`/`03` per-entry
> type bytes + a truncated final entry) is partly RE'd in §4i for a future exact decode. **All per-stack extra-data
> types are now sized** — `0x6E/0x1C/0x24/0x30` (§4i "Per-stack property sizing") **and** the structured `0x0D`
> (`12 + 14·(n/4)`, §4i) — so the per-stack walk is fully deterministic and the ≤512 B resync is a never-hit guard.

1. ~~**Skills**~~ — ✅ **DONE** (§4e). Located via the controlled-diff method: skills are floats in
   the PlayerRef (`0x14`) actor-value modification block, not an inline structure. Decoder + index map
   + same-length float editor shipped (Core `PlayerSkills`/`TrySetSkill`, CLI `skills`/`setskill`, GUI
   Skills tab). Remaining nuance: storage is sparse (modified-only) and the absolute-vs-modifier
   semantics of naturally-occurring small entries (vs console `setav`, which writes absolute) is not
   yet pinned — a follow-up controlled diff (read a single skill book, +3) could confirm it.
2. ~~**Inventory**~~ — ✅ **DONE** (§4g). Cracked via a controlled drop-1 diff: items live in a dedicated
   reference change form (iref = PlayerRef+1), entries are `[iref][7C][u32 count][7C]`, count edits are
   same-length. Decoder + `TrySetItemCount` + CLI `inventory`/`setcount` + GUI Inventory tab shipped.
   Entry references are **array index + 1** (§4g) — fixed via a controlled diff (Saves 28/29/30), which
   made the whole list correct: every stack resolves, no spurious rows, and previously-missing items
   (Antivenom, caps, Pip-Boy 3000, …) appear. The decoder is now **deterministic** (§4i): the 2048-byte window
   is gone, the per-stack **extra data** (condition / equipped / `0x21` ref) is decoded, and **condition is
   editable**. The list *start* is **deterministic on all 607 real saves** (vanilla 30/30, base VNV 98/98, VNV
   Extended 479/479): MOVE skip + the typed-entry ExtraDataList walk (variable order + modded `0x1D`/`0x75`) +
   bounded post-entry resync + the **ExtraDataList-header anchor** for bit2/bit10 havok-physics records → the
   `vsval` stack count → first item; the §4g scan is an unused safety net. This also **fixed 35 VNV Extended
   endgame inventories that previously decoded to empty**. Remaining nuance: editing targets the first stack of a
   given FormID (duplicate-FormID stacks are ambiguous by FormID alone), and the bit2/bit10 havok blob is *located
   past* but not byte-decoded (logged follow-up, §4i).
3. ~~**Item / form name resolution (FormID → display name)**~~ — ✅ **DONE** (§4h). Small custom TES4
   reader (`TesPlugin`/`PluginDatabase`/`GameDataLocator`) over the ESM/ESP masters builds a
   `FormID → FULL/EDID` index in the save's FormID space; wired into CLI `inventory`/`formids`/`names`
   and the GUI Inventory tab. Auto-detects the `Data` folder (override supported); DLC renumbering,
   zlib-compressed records, and `GRUP`-skipping over the 245 MB `FalloutNV.esm` are handled; `0xFF…`
   runtime forms → `(created)`. Verified on a real save (10/10 plugins, 3,985 named forms; Stimpak /
   Vault 21 Jumpsuit / … resolve). No off-the-shelf C# lib covers FNV (Mutagen is Skyrim/FO4/Starfield).
   (Note: early on a few inventory stacks showed `?` as placed references — that was the inventory
   reference off-by-one, since fixed in §4g; the player inventory now resolves completely.)
4. ~~**Caps / karma / XP**~~ — ✅ **DONE** (§4j for karma/XP).
   - **Caps** — confirmed (as predicted) to be an ordinary inventory stack, base FormID `0x0000000F`
     ("Bottle Cap"), not a standalone field. `FalloutSave.Caps` reads the stack count, `TrySetCaps` edits it
     (a thin wrapper over `TrySetItemCount`). CLI `caps`/`setcaps`, GUI `EditCaps`. Verified on real saves.
   - **Karma & XP** — two adjacent **float32** actor-values in the player **reference** change form
     (iref = PlayerRef + 1), inside its post-MOVE array (§4j): **karma = slot 100, XP = slot 101**. Cracked by
     the new `fdiff` R&D helper (float-aware aligned diff) on controlled pairs — vanilla Saves 33/34/35 (XP
     `10→60→110`, +50 each via `rewardxp`) and 35/36/37 (karma `0→100→200`, +100 each via `rewardkarma`); the
     two are cross-stable (XP unchanged across the karma saves and vice-versa). Slot indices confirmed on a
     second character (Mace Windu: karma 35, XP 338). `FalloutSave.Karma`/`Xp` + `TrySetKarma`/`TrySetXp`
     (same-length float splices), CLI `karma`/`xp`/`setkarma`/`setxp`, GUI `EditKarma`/`EditXp`.
5. ~~**Notes / message log (Pip-Boy "Data → Notes")**~~ — ✅ **DONE (read side)** (§4k). Cracked by a controlled
   diff (VNV Extended Saves 491→492: hover one inventory note to mark it read): reading a note writes **one
   zero-payload change form** on the note's inventory reference — `type 0x1F`, `changeFlags 0x80000000`, `len 0`
   — whose `refID` is the note's FormID-array index + 1 (the §4g convention), so the note = `FormIdArray[refID-1]`,
   a `NOTE` record. The read produced **exactly +1 change form** ("Recipes - Rose's Wasteland Omelet") and **all
   171 markers in the save resolve to NOTE (171/171)**. `FalloutSave.ReadNotes` → `PlayerNotes`/`NoteEntry`; CLI
   `notes` + GUI Notes tab (names via the masters, §4h). **Read-only** — the marker is a whole change form, so
   toggling read/unread is length-changing (§6.7), not a same-length splice.
   **Toward *full* notes decode:** the read **list** is done, but the marker's flag/type semantics, the
   acquired-but-unread list, and the inventory-side read state are not yet pinned. These are tracked as a
   checklist in **§4k.1** (each with the controlled-diff experiment that closes it) — the active worklist for
   "understand every element of notes."
6. ~~**General change-form record header**~~ — ✅ **DONE** (§4f). Walker (`EnumerateChangeForms`) reproduces
   all records exactly; CLI `walk` validates. Enables a future full change-form browser.
7. **Length-changing edits** (arbitrary rename, add/remove plugins, add/remove items) — requires rewriting every
   absolute offset in the File Location Table (and any internal absolute offsets). Deferred.
8. ~~**Quick win** — label the 43 Misc Stat indices by name~~ — ✅ **DONE**. The Misc Stats record stores
   exactly **43** positional counters; they're the fixed FO3/FNV engine misc-stat array, so each index has a
   canonical name (`Core/MiscStatNames.cs`, surfaced in CLI `stats` + the GUI Misc Stats tab). Names taken from
   the FNV `MiscStatEnum` (matortheeternal/esp.json) + a C# save-stats decoder, **verified against the corpus**:
   the count is exactly 43, and index 35 **"Total Things Killed"** = index 2 "People Killed" + index 3 "Creatures
   Killed" on every real save (pinned in a test), with index 39 "Barter Amount Traded" the large fast-growing
   caps total — both anchor the alignment. (A few slots are vestigial FO3 names the engine still tracks under the
   same index, e.g. "Bobbleheads Found"; the label matches what the save stores.)
9. **GUI/UX polish:** screenshot export (PNG), a raw hex viewer tab, backup management.
10. **Quest log + objectives decode** (◑ IN PROGRESS — partial findings, decode not finished). Surface the
    player's quests — **completed / active / failed** — and, within each, the **individual objectives/stages**
    (incl. *optional* ones). **Confirmed by a controlled diff (vanilla Saves 43→44: completed one objective + a
    new one appeared, while moving Doc Mitchell's House → Prospector Saloon):**
    - **FNV QUST change-form type byte = `0x07`** (low-6-bit form type 0x07). Multiple quests decode as type 0x07
      (e.g. "Ain't That a Kick in the Head" `0x00104C1C`, iref 2). This is the FNV-specific number (Skyrim's
      compacted index differs, like NOTE).
    - **changeFlags use the UESP QUST bit meanings** — the iref-2 record went `0x80000000` → `0xC0000000`, i.e.
      `bit31 CHANGE_QUEST_STAGES` → `+ bit30 CHANGE_QUEST_SCRIPT`, when a script value (`0x99`) was written. (So
      `ReferenceChangeForm.DescribeFlags` needs QUST-specific labels — it currently shows REFR labels for QUST; a
      §6 #13 follow-up.) `bit29 OBJECTIVES` was **not** set — the save stores **stages**, and the Pip-Boy derives
      objective display from the stage + the QUST's masters definition.
    - Quest data is **`0x7C`-delimited** (FNV style, not Skyrim's raw layout) and a stage/script update can be
      **length-changing** (iref-2 grew 150→155 by prepending the `[u32 script][7C]` field; the active quest "Back
      in the Saddle" appeared as a brand-new **inserted** type-0x07 record).
    **A 5-save in-place progression (vanilla Saves 43→44→45→46→47, "Back in the Saddle" `0x0010A214`: one task
    completed + a new one added per save, quest closed at 47) was captured and analysed — but the decode is NOT
    cracked, and the picture is messier than the UESP blueprint:**
    - **`type 0x07` is NOT exclusively QUST.** Many type-0x07 change forms are **map/cell fog-of-war records** whose
      data is a *growing exploration bitmap* (e.g. `0x0010D9F4`: a small dot expanding to a blob as the player
      explored Goodsprings). So quest change forms can't be identified by form-type alone — the masters (record
      type == `QUST`) are required.
    - **"Back in the Saddle" (`0x0010A214`) resolves to a QUST in the masters, yet its change form is type `0x41`
      (a placed *reference*), and across all five saves it changed only in two **increasing timer fields** — no
      stage/objective bytes moved.** So the quest's per-objective state is **not** sitting in an obvious diffable
      change form; it appears script/engine-buried (the `CHANGE_QUEST_SCRIPT` bit + a `[u32][7C]` script value seen
      on the chargen quest hints objective state may live in quest *script variables*, not a stages list).
    - The masters **QUST reader is suspect** — it named some forms correctly ("Ain't That a Kick" `0x00104C1C` ✓,
      "Classic Inspiration" is a real challenge-quest ✓) but the `0x0010A214`→reference contradiction suggests
      possible misalignment in the QUST group read; needs verifying before trusting QUST FormID→name.
    **Assessment:** this is a **deep, multi-session RE effort**, not a quick win — FNV's quest/objective storage
    diverges hard from Skyrim and isn't surfacing as a clean change-form diff even with good controlled saves.
    **Deferred.** When resumed, the surgical next steps are: (1) verify/fix the `TesPlugin` QUST reader; (2) a
    **zero-churn** controlled diff — console `setstage` on an active quest **without moving at all** — to isolate
    the bytes; (3) if stages aren't in the QUST change form, look at the script/Papyrus-equivalent global data.
    The 43→47 saves are preserved as the dataset.
11. **Item condition maximums (base-form Health)** (NEW — not started). Condition (`0x25`, §4i) is the item's
    **absolute current health**, not a percentage — verified on a real save: 9mm Pistol 45, 9mm SMG 205, Metal
    Armor 497.2, Grenade Rifle 99.9 (values differ per item). The **max** is the base form's **Health** stat,
    which differs per item and is **not yet decoded** — it lives in the `WEAP`/`ARMO`/… record's `DATA`
    subrecord, which `TesPlugin` already walks for the name (`FULL`) and could also read. Decoding it would let
    the tool show `cond X / max` (a true % bar), reject/clamp over-max edits, and offer "repair to full." **Open
    question (needs an in-game test):** what does the engine do with a stored condition *above* max — display
    >100%, clamp on load, or accept it? (We never write to originals, so this is a deliberate experiment, not an
    assumption.)
12. **Havok blob — "mod vs. situation" determination** (NEW follow-up to §4i / §10). The bit2/bit10
    `CHANGE_REFR_HAVOK_MOVE` pre-list physics blob appears **only in VNV Extended** (113 records), **never** in
    base VNV (98 saves, up to **level 31 / 39 h**) or vanilla. Within Extended it is **not** a clean
    progression threshold — early saves (L2/8/14) lack it, but it appears on some later ones (a L23 manual save,
    the L29 quicksave/autosaves) and **not** on others at similar levels (L16–18 manual saves) — so it reads as
    **situational**: the player reference is in **active Havok simulation at the instant of saving** (mid-jump /
    fall / ragdoll / moving surface), captured more often by autosaves/quicksaves. Yet base VNV at L31 *never*
    triggers it, which points at an **Extended-specific mod** keeping the player ref havok-active. The corpus
    alone can't separate "a mod causes it" from "the situation causes it." **Method:** controlled test — in base
    VNV *and* Extended, save while standing still vs. immediately after a jump/knockdown, manual vs. autosave,
    and compare the player-ref `changeFlags`. (Decode value is low — the list is already located correctly via
    the self-validating anchor, §10 — but it would settle the cause and could retire the anchor for a structural
    skip.) **Lead (§8a):** the UESP spec stores REFR `Havok data` as a `vsval count + uint8[count]` (length-prefixed)
    present iff `CHANGE_REFR_HAVOK_MOVE` — FNV's delimited preamble doesn't trivially decode as that size, but
    testing whether the FNV havok blob is length-prefixed is the concrete path to a deterministic skip.
13. ~~**Label the REFR/ACHR `changeFlags` bits from the UESP table**~~ — ✅ **DONE (labels shipped; per-bit FNV
    controlled-diff verification still owed).** `ReferenceChangeForm` now carries the full bit set: a shared table
    (`FlagBitLabels`, bits 0–7/25–31) plus `ActorFlagBitLabels`/`ObjectFlagBitLabels` for the bits that mean
    different things on actor vs object references (10/11/12/17/21/22/23). `DescribeFlags(flags, RefKind)` +
    `LabelForBit` pick the right label by record kind; with `RefKind.Unknown` an ambiguous bit shows **both** as
    `actor|object` so nothing is silently mislabelled. `refdump` passes `RefKind.Actor` for the player record (other
    refs stay Unknown). Output now reads e.g. `bit1(MOVE) bit4(SCALE) bit5(INVENTORY) bit11(ACTOR_PACKAGE_DATA)
    bit22(ACTOR_OVERRIDE_MODIFIERS) bit28(ANIMATION) bit29(ENCOUNTER_ZONE) bit31(GAME_ONLY)`. **Provenance:** bits
    1/2/5 are FNV-corpus-confirmed; the rest are cross-referenced from the UESP Skyrim spec (§8a) and surfaced for
    readability — the engine-level changeFlags enum is shared (1/2/5 match), but a controlled diff per bit (and a
    generic FNV form-type→`RefKind` classifier so non-player refs aren't all `Unknown`) is still owed. Tests pin the
    decode + the actor/object disambiguation. 727 green.
14. **Full ordered REFR/ACHR structural decode** (NEW — §8a). Use the spec's field order (Initial/MOVE →
    Havok(if bit2) → Flags(if bit0) → BaseObject(if bit7) → Scale(if bit4) → ExtraData → Inventory(if bit5) →
    Animation(if bit28)) as the blueprint to decode the player record end-to-end, which would reach the item list
    with **zero heuristics** (retiring the §10 anchor + the residual over-read) and expose more per-record state.
    Verify field-by-field against FNV (delimiter-aware); this is the principled successor to the current locators.
15. ~~**RefID 2-bit type handling**~~ — ✅ **DONE.** The 3-byte refID's top 2 bits are a type
    (`ReferenceChangeForm.RefIdType`/`RefIdValue`): 0 = FormID-array index, 1 = base-master formID, 2 = created
    (`0xFF`), 3 = unspecified. **Corpus scan settled which occur in FNV:** only **type 0** (array index) and
    **type 2** (created) — **type 1 and type 3 never appear** across vanilla + base VNV + VNV Extended, and
    type 2 occurs only on change-form **headers** (inventory item refs + extra-data refs are all type 0). Type-2
    (created) headers used to index out of bounds and resolve to `FormId 0`; **`FalloutSave.ResolveRefId`** now
    maps them to `0xFF000000 | value` (≈213k headers across the corpus: vanilla 135, base VNV 26k, ext 186k), so
    `EnumerateChangeForms` surfaces created references correctly — e.g. `refdump` of refID `0x801313` now reads
    `0xFF001313 (created)` instead of unknown. **Only types 0 and 2 are resolved** (the ones FNV uses); types 1/3
    are deliberately left as `0`/unknown rather than resolved on an unverified Skyrim-spec guess — per the repo's
    "don't guess" rule, surfacing an unseen type as unknown is honest and would flag the surprise. Unit + real-save
    tests pin the split and the created-form resolution. 768 green.

## 7. The controlled-diff methodology (how to crack §6.4 and the like)

`diff` is surgical on **same-size** save pairs (a value change keeps the file the same size):
1. In-game: **save A** → change exactly one thing (spend 1 skill point / read one skill book / drop
   one item) → **save B**.
2. `fnvsave diff A B` → the differing run(s) point at the bytes for that value (section-labeled).
3. Confirm by repeating with a different delta; then add a typed accessor + `TrySet…` same-length
   editor in `FalloutSave.cs` (mirror `TrySetSpecial` / `TrySetMiscStat`), expose in CLI + GUI, add a
   real-save test.

Diagnostics already available for RE: `probe` (FLT + what offsets point to), `hex <off> <len>`,
`findplayer`, `playerdump` (player change-form anchors + hex; `diff` also reports `playerBase±0x..` /
`playerRef±0x..` / `special±0x..` for change-form runs), `formids`, `globals`, `special`, `skills`,
`inventory`, `walk` (walk every change form + form-type histogram), `find <hexbytes>` (locate a byte
pattern + name the containing record), `irefscan <off> <len>` (resolve iref+count sites), two `diff`
modes: `diff a b cf` annotates each differing run with the change form that contains it, and
`idiff a b [clean]` aligns records by FormID across an insertion (drop/pickup) to surface the exact data change —
`clean` auto-hides the recurring per-reference game-time/havok churn (§4k.1 #7), e.g. 3,314 → 11 records on a notes diff;
and `fdiff a b [delta]` — a **float-aware** aligned diff that reads the full 4 bytes at every offset of each
same-length record and reports float32 fields that changed by ≈`delta` (a float change touches only its high
bytes, so it never shows as a clean byte-run delta in `diff`/`idiff`). `fdiff` is how karma/XP were found (§4j).

## 8a. Cross-reference with the UESP Skyrim/Gamebryo spec — validated matches + leads

The Skyrim save spec (§8) shares the **Gamebryo/Creation change-form model** FNV uses. **Caveat:** Skyrim ≠ FNV
byte-for-byte — FNV is FO3-era (pervasive `0x7C` delimiters, different form-type numbering, smaller global-data set,
some saves zlib-compress the player ACHR while FNV doesn't), so **every item below is an FNV-corpus hypothesis to
verify**, not a drop-in. That said, several of our independently-RE'd findings line up exactly, which is strong
validation of the method:

**Confirmed (our local RE matches the spec):**
- **MOVE block = 27 bytes** = the spec's REFR "Initial type 4" (`RefId cell/world` + `float pos[3]` + `rot[3]`). (§4i)
- **vsval `>>2` counts** — the spec's per-item `extra count` and inventory `count` are vsval, "shift right two bits
  to get the count" = our `b/4` propCount and `ReadVsval`. (§4i)
- **Per-stack extra-data sizes** — the spec's extraData catalog gives `0x1C`→3, `0x24`→2, `0x25`→4 ("appears to be a
  float"), independently matching our corpus-aligned sizes (§4i) and confirming `0x25` is a float.
- **`CHANGE_REFR_HAVOK_MOVE` = bit 2** and **`CHANGE_REFR_MOVE` = bit 1**, **`CHANGE_REFR_INVENTORY` = bit 5** —
  exactly our `FlagBitLabels`. (§4f/§4i)
- **Inventory item = `refId, count, vsval extraCount, extraData[…]`** — exactly our stack model (§4g/§4i).
- **Read-note marker** — the spec lists `CHANGE_NOTE_READ = 0x80000000`, matching our §4k marker `changeFlags` exactly.

**Leads (verify against FNV, then graduate to the §6 items noted):**
- **changeFlags bit labels** for REFR/ACHR — the spec names every bit (bit4 Scale, bit7 BaseObject; ACHR bit10
  LifeState, bit11 PackageData, bit22 OverrideModifiers, bit28 Animation, bit29 EncounterZone, bit31 GameOnly). Lets
  us replace our "label, don't guess" placeholders with confirmed names. → §6 #13.
- **Havok data is length-prefixed** — the spec's REFR layout has `Havok data = vsval count + uint8[count]` present
  *iff* `CHANGE_REFR_HAVOK_MOVE`. FNV's delimited preamble (`E1 10 7C 04 7C 4C 7C` / `49 11 7C 05 7C 4C 7C`) doesn't
  trivially decode as that size, so it's not a free win — but it's a concrete hypothesis to test that could turn the
  §10 anchor scan into a deterministic skip. → §6 #12.
- **Ordered REFR/ACHR field model** — Initial(MOVE) → Havok(if bit2) → Flags(if bit0) → BaseObject(if bit7) →
  Scale(if bit4) → ExtraData(if extra bits) → Inventory(if bit5) → Animation(if bit28). A structural blueprint to
  decode the *whole* player record (and reach the item list with zero heuristics). → §6 #14.
- **QUST change form** — quest **stages** live under `CHANGE_QUEST_STAGES` (bit31) as `vsval count` of
  `{sint16 stage, uint8 done}`; **objectives** under `CHANGE_QUEST_OBJECTIVES` (bit29). Direct blueprint for the
  quest log. → §6 #10.
- **RefID 2-bit type** — top 2 bits of the 3-byte refID: 0 = formID-array index (value−1, our `+1` rule), 1 = base
  ESM formID directly, 2 = created (0xFF), 3 = ?. A framework for refIDs that currently don't resolve. → §6 #15.
- **Global-data type labels** — spec types 5=Effects, 7=Audio, 8=SkyCells (FNV table 1 has types 0–11; 0–6 likely
  shared, 7–11 need FNV verification — FNV's set differs from Skyrim's 0–8 + 100+). → refines §4c.
- **More extra-data types to name** — the spec catalog labels several we haven't: `0x2a`=lock (level + KEYM refId),
  `0x70`=encounter-zone refId, `0x88`=QUST alias assignment, `0x8e`=outfit refId, `0x21`="could be owner". Candidate
  semantics for our sized-but-unlabelled types (§10).

## 9. Known limitations / risks
- Change-form **internals**: skills (§4e), inventory item stacks (§4g), and per-stack extra data —
  condition (`0x25`, editable), equipped (`0x16`), and the `0x21` ref (§4i) — are decoded; perks and most
  other per-record state are not yet decoded — needs more controlled diffs. The walker (§4f) makes these
  reachable record-by-record.
- The inventory walk is **deterministic** per-stack (exact extra-data lengths; no window — §4i) **and the list
  start is deterministic on all 607 real saves** (vanilla 30/30, base VNV 98/98, VNV Extended 479/479): MOVE skip
  → sized/anchored ExtraDataList → the `vsval` stack count → first item. The §4g scan is retained only as a
  never-needed safety net. The residual caveats (§10) are about *internal* decode, not the list start.
- The bit2/bit10 (`CHANGE_REFR_HAVOK_MOVE`) pre-list region is **located past, not byte-decoded**: it's a
  variable-length Havok physics blob (§4i), and the list is found by the self-validating ExtraDataList-header
  anchor instead of by sizing the blob. Exact blob decode is a logged follow-up; the list is correct without it.
- The **`vsval` reveals a benign over-read** it doesn't fully eliminate: on a few saves the decoder reads slightly
  *more* stacks than the engine's count (interspersed non-item over-reads the name filter already hides; **0
  under-reads across all 607** — never *fewer*). Sizing **every** per-stack property type (§4i — incl. the structured
  `0x0D`) **reduced** this with each fix strictly monotone: vanilla over-read 2 → **0**, base VNV 8 → 4, Extended
  318 → 314 (every changed save decreased; **0 became under-read**). The residual over-read on Extended comes from the
  bit2/bit10 havok-blob anchor path, **not** per-stack sizing (all per-stack types are now sized). Core keeps the full
  chain (truncating by position would drop real trailing items); dropping the rest needs the masters (CLI/GUI).
- The `0x21`/`0x1C`/`0x24`/`0x30`/`0x6E`/`0x0D` per-stack extra-data types are all **sized** (lengths right, walk fully
  deterministic — the ≤512 B resync is now a never-hit safety net) but their **semantics** aren't pinned: `0x21` is an
  attached weapon mod on weapons (reused for other linked refs, a VNV "Bill of Sale"); the rest (incl. `0x0D`'s
  `ref` + `(u32,f64)` pairs) were sized structurally by corpus alignment (§4i).
- Inventory editing targets the **first** stack of a given FormID; duplicate-FormID stacks (same item,
  different extra data) can't be disambiguated by FormID alone yet.
- SPECIAL locator relies on the player-name field appearing in the player base record (held on all 16
  saves); a save lacking it would return null (handled gracefully).
- Only **same-length** edits are supported by design (see §1). Length-changing edits are unsafe until
  full offset-fixup is implemented.
- Read notes (§4k) capture only notes the player has **opened** (each leaves a change-form marker); the **full**
  Pip-Boy list incl. **unread** notes is now decoded via `PipBoyNotes` (§4k.1 #4 — note refs in the player inventory
  record ∪ read markers). Two soft caveats: it needs the masters to tell which references are `NOTE` records (no
  masters → read markers only), and the ref-list's exact byte framing isn't individually parsed (the scan finds note
  refs directly, robust to framing) — neither affects the verified results.
- `findplayer`'s refID scan can report false positives in data; the player records are confirmed via
  the SPECIAL/name anchor, which is the reliable locator.

## 10. Accepted caveats (good enough now — fully fixable later)

Approximations we **deliberately ship** because they're verified-correct on every real save today, each with
a clear path to a fully-principled fix once more of the body is decoded. These aren't bugs or risks (those
live in §9) — they're "good enough, revisit when the RE catches up." **The throughline:** a `.fos` body is
deterministic engine output, so *every* one of these becomes exact once we decode enough of the surrounding
structure. None is a fundamental wall.

| Caveat | Why it's good enough today | The full fix (and what unblocks it) |
|---|---|---|
| **bit2/bit10 havok blob is located past, not byte-decoded** (§4i; VNV Extended only, 113 records). The list start is deterministic on all 607 saves, but on `CHANGE_REFR_HAVOK_MOVE` records the pre-list physics blob is skipped via the self-validating ExtraDataList-header anchor rather than by sizing the blob. | The anchor + "pick the real (longest) chain" rule lands the list correctly (and *fixed* 35 endgame saves that previously decoded to empty); the blob's bytes aren't needed to find the list. **Grammar now confirmed** (§4i: 7-byte preamble + 58-byte `pos/quat/03/vel/angvel` entries + truncated final + trailing variable `[4][7C]` slot array). | A full structural sizer is **intentionally not built**: the blob is genuinely variable-length with a truncated final entry, and its trailing slot array's values locally collide with the ExtraDataList header — so a sizer would *still* need the anchor's self-validation at the tail (zero correctness gain over the working anchor). `ReferenceChangeForm.HavokPhysicsEntryLength` (test-pinned) recognises one entry for any future exact decode. |
| **`vsval` over-read** — the decoder reads *more* stacks than the engine's `vsval` count (interspersed non-items the name filter hides); the full chain is kept rather than truncated (§9). **Measured: under-read 0 across all 607** (never drops items), benign over-read on some — now **reduced** by per-stack property sizing (§4i): 11 modded saves dropped phantom stacks, several to `vsval` exactly. | The extra stacks are hidden in display, and truncating by position would drop real trailing items. | Drop the residual `0x0D`-block over-reads — either by sizing `0x0D`, or using the `vsval` as the authoritative count (the name filter for that lives in the CLI/GUI, not `Core`; surface the vsval there as the cross-check). |
| **Inventory edits target the *first* stack** of a given FormID (§4g). | Duplicate-FormID stacks (same item, different extra data) are uncommon; the everyday case is unambiguous. | Address stacks by file offset / extra-data signature rather than FormID — straightforward once a UI/CLI affordance picks the specific stack. |
| **Per-stack extra-data semantics unpinned** — `0x21`/`0x1C`/`0x24`/`0x30`/`0x6E`/`0x0D` are all **sized** (by corpus alignment, §4i) but **unlabelled**. | Lengths are right so the per-stack walk is **fully deterministic** (every type sized; the ≤512 B resync is a never-hit safety net); sizes pinned across 607 saves (e.g. `0x6E` gap 2 on 929/929; `0x0D` = `12 + 14·(n/4)`). | Controlled diffs (attach a known weapon mod; inspect a modded weapon) to *name* each sized type — e.g. confirm what `0x0D`'s `(u32, f64)` pairs are (script vars? effects?). |
| **Skills are sparse** (only modified entries stored) and the absolute-vs-modifier semantics of small natural entries aren't pinned (§4e). | Reads/edits exactly what's stored; SPECIAL/skill sums verified across all 16 saves. | A single +3 skill-book controlled diff to confirm modifier vs absolute, then enumerate the full 13 from base + perks + tags. |

> **Is the inventory start *fully* deterministic now?** **Yes — on all 607 real saves** (vanilla 30/30, base VNV
> 98/98, VNV Extended 479/479). The vanilla path is a pure structural walk (MOVE + havok array + sized
> ExtraDataList + `vsval` anchor); modded saves use the same typed-entry walk (variable order + `0x1D`/`0x75`) plus
> a bounded post-entry resync; and bit2/bit10 records — whose pre-list region is a variable-length Havok physics
> blob, not a sized array — are located by the self-validating ExtraDataList-header anchor (choosing the real
> longest chain over the §4g scan). The §4g scan is now an unused safety net. The only thing not yet *byte*-decoded
> is the physics blob itself, which the list doesn't need. Verified **0 under-reads** and display **byte-identical**
> across all 607 except **35 strict corrections** (endgame inventories that previously decoded to empty).

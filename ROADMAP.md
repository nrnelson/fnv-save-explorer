# FNV Save Explorer — Roadmap & Status

A cold-start working document: where the project is, exactly what's been reverse-engineered, and
how to resume. For the user-facing overview see [README.md](README.md); for build/agent notes see
[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

---

## 1. Goal & scope

Build a from-scratch tool to **analyze** and **edit** Fallout: New Vegas `.fos` save files.
Chosen direction: C# / .NET 10, a reusable **Core library** plus a **WPF GUI** and a **CLI**, and
to **reverse-engineer the save body** (globals, change forms) — not just the documented header.

The single principle that makes editing safe: the **retention model**. `FalloutSave` keeps the
entire original byte array and only decodes regions we understand, recording the offset of each
editable field. Saving with no edits reproduces the file byte-for-byte; edits are **same-length
splices** so nothing shifts. This is mandatory because the body's File Location Table stores
*absolute* offsets — a length change would invalidate them. **Never break round-trip identity.**

---

## 2. Quick start

```pwsh
dotnet build FnvSaveExplorer.slnx            # NOTE: solution is .slnx (XML), not .sln
dotnet test  tests/FnvSaveExplorer.Tests/FnvSaveExplorer.Tests.csproj
dotnet run   --project src/FnvSaveExplorer.App                 # WPF GUI
dotnet run   --project src/FnvSaveExplorer.Cli -- <command> "<save.fos>"
```

Real saves for testing live in `C:\Users\<user>\Documents\My Games\FalloutNV\Saves\` (16 present
during development: two characters "Nathan" and "Mace Windu" at various progression, plus autosave/
quicksave). The test theory auto-discovers them (and a local `samples/`) and skips if none exist.
**Never write to the originals** — all edit demos write to new files.

CLI commands: `dump`, `check`, `flt`, `probe`, `hex`, `globals`, `stats`, `setstat`, `formids`,
`findplayer`, `special`, `setspecial`, `setlevel`, `diff`. Run with no args to list them.

---

## 3. Architecture & key files

- **`src/FnvSaveExplorer.Core`** (`net10.0`, UI-agnostic)
  - `FalloutSave.cs` — parser, retention writer, all decoders + same-length editors.
  - `ByteReader.cs` — little-endian cursor; throws `SaveFormatException` with the failing offset.
  - `FileLocationTable.cs`, `GlobalData.cs`, `MiscStats.cs`, `PlayerSpecial.cs`, `SaveScreenshot.cs`.
- **`src/FnvSaveExplorer.App`** (`net10.0-windows`, WPF MVVM) — `MainViewModel.cs`, `MainWindow.xaml`
  (+ code-behind for file dialogs). Tabs: Plugins, File Location Table, Edit (name/level/save#/SPECIAL),
  Misc Stats, Body. Left panel: screenshot + character summary.
- **`src/FnvSaveExplorer.Cli`** — `Program.cs` (top-level statements; all commands + diagnostics).
- **`tests/FnvSaveExplorer.Tests`** — xUnit; 70 tests. Synthetic-save unit tests + theories over
  every real `.fos` found (round-trip identity, globals, Misc Stats, SPECIAL locate + edit).

---

## 4. The `.fos` format — validated spec

Little-endian; signature `FO3SAVEGAME` (shared with FO3; NV adds a 64-byte language block). Header
region uncompressed. Strings are `[u16 len][0x7C][bytes][0x7C]`; `0x7C` ("|") delimits fields
throughout the file (header, globals, change forms).

### 4a. Header (offsets from a real save)
```
0x00  char[11]  "FO3SAVEGAME"
0x0B  u32       saveHeaderSize        -> screenshot starts at 0x0F + saveHeaderSize   (KEY)
0x0F  u32       version (0x30)
0x13  0x7C
0x14  64 bytes  language (null-padded "ENGLISH")   [NV only]
      u32 width, u32 height, u32 saveNumber        (each followed by 0x7C)
      str name, str title, u32 level, str location, str playtime
      screenshot = width*height*3 bytes raw RGB (e.g. 512x288)
      u8 trailer (~0x1B; docs say 0x15 but it varies)
      u32 pluginStructSize, u8 pluginCount, 0x7C, then pluginCount x prefixed strings
      -> body begins (BodyOffset)
```

### 4b. File Location Table (body start) — verified across all 16 saves
Five absolute offsets then three counts (NV has one fewer global-data table than Skyrim):
```
[0] FormIdArrayCountOffset   [1] UnknownTable3Offset (footer near EOF)
[2] GlobalData1Offset (12 records)   [3] ChangeFormsOffset   [4] GlobalData3Offset (1 type-1000 rec)
[5] GlobalData1Count (=12)   [6] GlobalData3Count (=1)   [7] ChangeFormCount (e.g. 4134)
```

### 4c. Global data — `[type:u32][length:u32][data]`
Table 1 holds 12 records, types 0–11: `0`=Misc Stats, `1`=Player Location, `2`=TES, `3`=Global
Variables (large), `4`=Created Objects, `6`=Weather, … (7–11 unlabeled).

**Misc Stats (type 0):** `u32 count, 0x7C, then count x (u32 value, 0x7C)` — Pip-Boy counters
(quests/kills/locations…). Positional (no names stored). Decoded + editable.

### 4d. FormID array & change forms
- FormID array: `u32 count` then `count` x `u32` (full FormIDs; high byte = mod index).
- Change forms reference forms by **iref** = index into the FormID array, encoded as a **3-byte
  big-endian refID**. Player: FormID `0x07` (base TESNPC_) and `0x14` (PlayerRef ACHR); find their
  irefs in the array, scan change forms for the 3-byte refID to locate the records.
- **Player SPECIAL:** 7 consecutive bytes immediately before the length-prefixed player-name field
  inside the player base record (fenced by `0x7C`). Located by name-adjacency within the change-forms
  region. Verified: every save sums to 40 (chargen budget), consistent per character. Editable.

---

## 5. Completed (with verification)

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| Header / screenshot / plugins parse | ✅ validated on 16 saves |
| Byte-identical round-trip (open→save) | ✅ all 16 incl. 4 MB autosave/quicksave |
| Same-length edits: level, save#, name | ✅ proven (size unchanged, re-parses) |
| File Location Table decode | ✅ verified across 16 saves |
| Global data tables (12 records) | ✅ enumerated |
| Misc Stats decode + edit | ✅ (e.g. stat 1→999 = 2-byte diff) |
| FormID array + iref resolution | ✅ locates player change forms in all 16 |
| Player SPECIAL decode + edit | ✅ all 16 sum to 40; edit round-trips |
| WPF GUI (metadata, screenshot, plugins, stats, SPECIAL edit) | ✅ launches + builds |
| `diff` tool (pinpoints same-size changes) | ✅ Strength 5→6 = 1 byte |
| Tests | ✅ 70 xUnit, all green |

**Editable today:** level, save number, name (same-length), Misc Stats, full SPECIAL — all safe
same-length splices.

## 6. Next steps (in priority order)

1. **Skills** — not stored as plain inline values. The player base record after SPECIAL is the name
   then ~50 small signed floats (**FaceGen** face-morph data); the PlayerRef record is world
   position/rotation then a long run of **zeroed actor-value modifiers**. So skills live in an
   actor-value structure that doesn't surface by inspection → use the **controlled-diff method**
   (§7). Add a typed accessor + same-length editor once located.
2. **Inventory** — in the PlayerRef (0x14) change form; items are form references (likely irefs) with
   counts/extra-data. Locate via controlled diff (drop/pick up one item) + cross-reference FormID array.
3. **Caps / karma / XP** — single values; controlled-diff to locate, then same-length edit.
4. **General change-form record header** — the per-record `[refID][changeFlags][type][version]
   [length...]` layout to *walk* all ~4134 records (enables a full change-form browser). Needs careful
   work; the `0x7C` delimiters appear both structurally and inside binary data, so length-driven
   walking (not delimiter-splitting) is required.
5. **Length-changing edits** (arbitrary rename, add/remove plugins) — requires rewriting every
   absolute offset in the File Location Table (and any internal absolute offsets). Deferred.
6. **Quick win (no new saves):** label the 43 Misc Stat indices by name (diff an early vs late save
   of the same character) so the GUI reads "Quests Completed: 4" instead of "[0]: 4".
7. **GUI/UX polish:** screenshot export (PNG), a raw hex viewer tab, backup management.

---

## 7. The controlled-diff methodology (how to crack §6.1–6.3)

`diff` is surgical on **same-size** save pairs (a value change keeps the file the same size):
1. In-game: **save A** → change exactly one thing (spend 1 skill point / read one skill book / drop
   one item) → **save B**.
2. `fnvsave diff A B` → the differing run(s) point at the bytes for that value (section-labeled).
3. Confirm by repeating with a different delta; then add a typed accessor + `TrySet…` same-length
   editor in `FalloutSave.cs` (mirror `TrySetSpecial` / `TrySetMiscStat`), expose in CLI + GUI, add a
   real-save test.

Diagnostics already available for RE: `probe` (FLT + what offsets point to), `hex <off> <len>`,
`findplayer`, `formids`, `globals`, `special`, `diff`.

- Vault-Tec Labs "FOS file format" (falloutmods wiki) — header + stats tables.
- UESP "Oblivion / Skyrim Save File Format" — change-record / FormID-array model NV mirrors.
- FNVEdit + GECK — resolve FormIDs/irefs while reverse-engineering.
- Note: those wikis block automated fetchers on `/wiki/` URLs; Fandom's `api.php?action=parse` works.

## 9. Known limitations / risks
- Change-form **internals** (inventory/perks/skills) are not yet decoded — needs controlled diffs.
- SPECIAL locator relies on the player-name field appearing in the player base record (held on all 16
  saves); a save lacking it would return null (handled gracefully).
- Only **same-length** edits are supported by design (see §1). Length-changing edits are unsafe until
  full offset-fixup is implemented.
- `findplayer`'s refID scan can report false positives in data; the player records are confirmed via
  the SPECIAL/name anchor, which is the reliable locator.
